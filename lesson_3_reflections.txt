When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use the remote repository if working as a team on a project or when working between multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You may have made changes on your local repository which you want to push to the master.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	I would use a fork when I want to work on a project for which I am not a contributor.  
	I would use clone when working from a repository for which I am an owner or contributor.  
	I would branch when working with a clone or fork when I want to preserve the master file 
	and work on new features or testing.

What is the benefit of having a copy of the last known state of the remote stored locally?

	It would allow you to view changes between the local master and the origin/master.
	You could then decide if you wish to merge those changes or continue working on the 
	seperate branch.

How would you collaborate without using Git or GitHub? What would be easier, and what would be harder?
	
	You could do it using Dropbox or a similar service; however it would be a nightmare
	trying to manage the project and keep things organized.  Using a version control
	system like Git/Github is much easier once you get past the learning curve.

When would you want to make changes in a separate branch rather than directly in master? What benefits does each approach have?

	I would use a seperate branch if I were testing a new feature or making radical changes.  
	Seperate branches also make a lot of sense if you are collaboratively working on 
	projects.
