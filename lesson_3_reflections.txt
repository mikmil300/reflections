When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  I would use the remote repository if working as a team on a project or when working between multiple computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

	You may have made changes on your local repository which you want to push to the master.

Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

	I would use a fork when I want to work on a project for which I am not a contributor.  
	I would use clone when working from a repository for which I am an owner or contributor.  
	I would branch when working with a clone or fork when I want to preserve the master file 
	and work on new features or testing.
